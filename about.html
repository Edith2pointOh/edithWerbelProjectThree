    <h2>How the DeskFit <span>X</span> Pomodoro system works</h2>
    <p class="about">The Pomodoro Technique is proven time management and productivity system. Simply put, you work at a
        task without
        interuption for 25 minutes, before a 5 minute break. After four 25 minute periods (called pomodoros) take a
        longer 25 minute break.</p>
    <p class="about">The DeskFit X Pomodoro system encourages you to move during your breaks and presents an easy
        movement to perform
        to break the mold your chair is making of your body. So put on your Lulu Lemons!</p>
    <p class="about">This system, developed by a former personal trainer learning to program won't give you the beach
        body of your
        dreams but it will help you work smarter with your mind and body.</p>
